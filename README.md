# 👀 Vue Project Advices

## 👻 Styling 
### It's better to use ui libs like [vuetifyj](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), [vuematerial](https://vuematerial.io/) instead writing custom sass styles 
- a11y, dark/light build-in support 
- fast development
- Customization theme (palette colors, spacing)

## 😺 Support SSR
### Maybe nuxt stack is better, need to discuss advantages/disadvantages of nuxt/quasar
- [nuxt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt)
- [@nuxtjs/pwa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/pwa)

## 🤞 Need tests(jest, testing-library, playwright)
- [testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/vue-testing-library)
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- e2e tests: [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)

## 😿 PWA features are not implemented 
- offline mode 
- service worker

## 🦄 Use Appollo-client instead of vuex and axios combination
## 🌛 Add Typescript 
## 🐋 Add eslint, prettier, lint-staged, git-hooks
